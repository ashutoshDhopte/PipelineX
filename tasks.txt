Objectives:

1. Datatypes (1 API call for all tables)    (Input+Output)
2. Joins (1 API call for all tables)    (Input+Output)
3. Data cleaning
    a. data type enforcement (in-place)
    b. replace missing value with "unknown" for categorical or mean for quantitaive
    c. replace outliers with point b values
4. create meta data and final csv files, and save in RDS and S3 resp.
5.
